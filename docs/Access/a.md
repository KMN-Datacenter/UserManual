# Accounts
Authorization, authentication, and accounting (AAA) are centralized and are based on Microsoft's Active Directory.
This is a separate directory service from that of ATU. 

Any lecture or researcher may request access and an account will be created in the form *firstname.surname*

Any lecturer may request student access and this is normally a class group. The lecture should forward a CSV file of students, typically an export from _Blackboard_. Account names will be the student's L number.

## Suitability
Access is intended for technically proficient people only. If you are not a Computing student/staff member, you will struggle to gain any benefit.

We do not have a help desk!

Note that we are not service providers, you need to discuss requirements in advance and we do *not* offer an SLA. We will not be able to respond quickly during the academic year or at short notice.

## Access from ATU Donegal
There is network access from the ATU Donegal Port Road campus to the data center. 
We are outside the perimeter firewall, you may access the data center from the laboratories, but there is no access from systems back into the campus.
Since 2025, there is no access from the Wireless network.
